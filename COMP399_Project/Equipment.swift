Purpose:
This is equipment superclass class for all equipment. All equipment need the property to be equipped and will have an rarity. Afterwards each subclass of equipment is made here. They will adjust the stats of the users when equipped or taken off.

Subroutine Purpose:

 Equipment Class:
 use: This will equip the item to the user and adjust their stats

 display: it will show the attributes of the equipment.

 All subclasses of equipment implement the use function and increase stats according to what is received through the constructor. Some subclasses increase luck some increase defense or some other attribute.

 All subclasses of equipment implment display and they will show all their attributes
